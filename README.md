# ECE-297
Map Me GIS
In this course I  built a software program  in a team of 3 students that provides functionality similar to Google Maps,
plus some other features-
• Read in a database of all the intersections and streets in a city.
• Draw the resulting map nicely and let the user interact (pan, zoom, highlight, etc.) with it.
• Find travel routes between two intersections in the city and give directions to a user.
• Find a good order of deliveries and a good driving path for a courier company driver to complete
his/her list of daily deliveries
